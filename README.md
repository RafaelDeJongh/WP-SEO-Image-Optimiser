# WP-SEO-Image-Optimiser
A plugin that sanitizes image titles and copies them to other fields to improve SEO.

## About

For example, when you upload `My-Awesome_image.jpg`, WordPress will use `My-Awesome_image` as the title and leave other fields empty.

With this plugin the title will be cleaned automatically to `My Awesome Image`.

You can configure the plugin to copy the title to the ALT text, Description and Caption fields if you so desire.

You can also process existing images in your site to make sure there are no empty ALT or Description fields that could be useful for Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)

## Requirements

It is always a good practice to keep your WordPress installation updated, so make sure you are on the newest release. The plugin should work fine on WordPres 5.0 and above.
