# WP-SEO-Image-Optimiser
A plugin that sanitizes image titles and copies them to other fields to improve SEO.

## About

For example, when you upload `My-Awesome_image.jpg`, WordPress will use `My-Awesome_image` as the title and leave other fields empty.

With this plugin the title will be cleaned automatically to `My Awesome Image`.

You can configure the plugin to copy the title to the alt text, description and caption fields if you want.

You can also process existing images in your site to make sure there are no empty fields.

## Requirements

It's always good practice to keep your WordPress installation updated, so make sure you're on the newest release. The plugin should work fine on WordPres 4.7 and above.
